# Jerky Mod
[Download on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jerky-smoked-meat-mod)

Minecraft mod that adds jerky food items to the game. Replaces the smoker recipes to produce jerky and to take longer. Jerky has less nutritional value than cooked meat counterparts, but can be configured with mods like [Spoiled](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spoiled) to rot more slowly.
